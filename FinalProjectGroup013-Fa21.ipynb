    "Pokémon Showdown is a Pokémon battle simulator that allows players to build teams of Pokémon and battle each other online with various battle formats. In a Pokémon battle, each player has a team of 6 Pokémon, and each Pokémon has 4 different moves that can be used in battles. Every Pokémon has 1 or 2 types, which determines their strengths and weaknesses against other Pokémon types, and each move also has 1 type. Each Pokémon is assigned a limited pool of usable moves that can include other types besides its own. Prior to the 6th generation of Pokémon, there were 17 Pokémon types: Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, Dark, Dragon, and Steel. However, Gen VI saw the introduction of the Fairy type, which created a major shift in type dynamics. Fairy types are weak to Poison and Steel and super effective against Dark, Fighting, and, most notably, Dragon. Fairy is the only type that is both super effective against and completely immune to Dragon types, a type which has historically been popular in competitive Pokémon battles because of their high stats (the highest average stat total of all types, according to Bulbapedia) and few type weaknesses. Nicholas Vadivelu’s analysis on competitive Pokémon found that Fairy type Pokemon have become quite prominent in upper competitive tiers, which effectively puts them in direct competition with Dragon types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokemon Showdown has three major formats: Ubers, OU and UU. Each format has different restrictions on what Pokemon are allowed based on how dominating a Pokemon is. UU has the most restrictions on Pokemon of these three tiers, banning Pokemon that are too powerful to allow Pokemon that are less used to be more effective. Ubers has the least restrictions and allows players to use and pokemon that they would like with a few minor exceptions. OU is in the middle of UU and Ubers as it has more restrictions than Ubers but less restrictions than UU.The introduction of Fairy types in generation 6 affect the use of Dragon types differently in each format as different Fairy types are allowed in each tier. \n",

    "With the addition of the new Fairy type in Generation 6, we predicted that types effective against Fairy type (Poison, Steel) would increase in usage, while the Dragon type, which is weak to Fairy type, would decrease in usage. We would also expect Ice types, another counter to Dragon types, to decrease in usage. We predicted that the trend would remain consistent as more Fairy type Pokemon are added to the game with each generation."
